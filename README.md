This application is designed to produce high-quality README files for a user. I was motivated by the idea of streamlining my README creating process, as there is a lot of repetition in the structure and design of READMEs and I wanted to simplify the steps. I built this application to enable the quick and effective production of a README file to suit any type of application. I learnt a great deal about the power of node.js and writing files through creating this project
